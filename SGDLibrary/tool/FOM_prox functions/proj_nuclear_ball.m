function out = proj_nuclear_ball(X,r)
%PROJ_NUCLEAR_BALL computes the orthogonal projection onto the nuclear-norm ball
%                   {X: sum(svd(X)) <= r} 
%
%  Usage: 
%  out = PROJ_NUCLEAR_BALL(X,[r])
%  ===========================================
%  INPUT:
%  X - matrix to be projected
%  r - radius (scalar) - [default: 1]
%  ===========================================
%  Assumptions:
%  r > 0
%  ===========================================
%  Output:
%  out - projection matrix
